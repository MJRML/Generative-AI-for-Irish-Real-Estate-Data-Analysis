The housing market data from the Daft dataset provides insights into the current trends within the market. The average price of €427,750 indicates that the market is relatively high-priced, which could suggest demand outstripping supply in certain areas, especially in Dublin, the most listed county.

The average number of bedrooms being 2.7 and bathrooms being 1.8 gives an indication that properties listed tend to be moderately sized and suitable for small to medium-sized households. The average floor area of 397.7 m² suggests that properties in this market tend to offer a decent amount of living space.

The most common property type being detached implies a preference for standalone housing units among buyers or renters in this market. This could be due to factors such as privacy, space, or lifestyle preferences driving this trend.

One interesting pattern to note is the dominance of Dublin as the most listed county. This could indicate that Dublin has a strong real estate market with high demand for properties, potentially driven by factors such as economic opportunities, amenities, and infrastructure within the city.
